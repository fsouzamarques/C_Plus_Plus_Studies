/*Write a 99bottles.cpp program that prints the verses of the “99 Bottles” song. Each stanza goes something like this:

i bottles of pop on the wall.
Take one down and pass it around.
i-1 bottles of pop on the wall.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  // Write a for loop here:
  
  for (int i = 99; i > 0; i--)
{
  cout << i << " bottles of pop on the wall." << endl;
  cout << "Take one down and pass it around." << endl;
  cout << i - 1 << " bottles of pop on the wall." << endl;
